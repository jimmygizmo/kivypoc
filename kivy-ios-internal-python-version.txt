TODO: Double check on usage of 3.7.10. I was watching the log of the very big build of kivy-ios (toolchain build kivy)
and I saw something install Python 3.8.2. I also saw Python 3.8 in other build info and did not notice any other
Python versions. Not explicitly confirmed yet but 3.7 info looks like it might be outdated.
The main instructions I am currently following are from https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-ios.html
but the mention of Python version is only on a web page not in one place and could easily be outdated info.
TODO: Plan to change to Python 3.8.2 for the kivypoc venv. Will need to install this with Pyenv and we will no
longer need 3.7
CLARIFICATION: Once built and deployed using Kivy-IOS, your Python code will be running there under Python 3.8.2
and you cannot easily or not at all control this version. So that your IDE and local testing is appropriate, this
is why you want your local virtual environment to exactly match the version you will be deploying with.
TODO: Re-write this entire doc to incorporate this clarification and the updated version info.
