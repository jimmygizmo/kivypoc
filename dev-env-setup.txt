Instructions lean towards MacOS but are easily adaptable.

Use Pyenv to manage Python versions. Period. Install it with Homebrew.
Also install Pyenv-Virtualenv with Homebrew. (NOTE: Exact versions may differ from below.)

Research sufficiently first.
The main thing not to miss is after installing the two versions of Python (since you need both a 2 and a 3)
you need to issue the correct 'global' command so your python vs python2 vs python3 commands point to things
correctly. As of this point in time, to me at least 'correctly' means that just 'python'
(without a 2 or 3 on the end) will point to Python 3. Apple just made this change for Mac OS,
even though we are deliberately NOT using the MacOS-installed python.
Anyhow, the correct 'pyenv global' configuration command you need to make for this too all come out
correctly will be something similar to:
pyenv global 3.9.5 2.7.18

This should give you a 'pyenv versions' that shows:
➜  ~ pyenv versions
  system
* 2.7.18 (set by /Users/bilbo/.pyenv/version)
* 3.9.5 (set by /Users/bilbo/.pyenv/version)


The result should also be such that your python -V, python2 -V, python3 -V show the following:
➜  ~ python -V; python2 -V; python3 -V
Python 3.9.5
Python 2.7.18
Python 3.9.5

Also note, you will use 'pyenv which' to show the path to the binaries and it should look like this:
➜  ~ pyenv which python; pyenv which python2; pyenv which python3
/Users/bilbo/.pyenv/versions/3.9.5/bin/python
/Users/bilbo/.pyenv/versions/2.7.18/bin/python2
/Users/bilbo/.pyenv/versions/3.9.5/bin/python3

That is the basis for ALL python work I do and I strongly STRONGLY recommend this.
I know ALL of the other ways to use Python on MacOS and all of them will run into problems in various scenarious.
This is the only really correct and powerful and trouble-free 'professional' way to develop with Python on
MacOS and it will remain so for some time while there is any Python 2 code around, which will be true for years.

This is not just important because Python 2 will be around for a while, this is also important because there can
be many real world scenarios in which you need to switch between different versions of Python.

What we have set up so far is just our Python. We also need to use Python Virtual Environments.
