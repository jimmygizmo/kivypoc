You don't need a separate .kv file. You can use the Builder class to inline the kv code from within your
Python code.

You will need other stuff, but specifically, you need to import:
from kivy.lang import Builder

----------------------------------
Then do something like the below. In the example I took this from, it was done very soon after the imports,
which makes sense. I think in a lot of cases you will want the kv in a file, but perhaps there are desirable
ways to inject kv code in other contexts. Loading sub-views/modules, widgets, themes .. yet files might
still be involved in different ways; kv templates etc. I've only just started looking at Kivy in detail so we
will see. Anyhow, this does work for a simple example:


Builder.load_string("""
<CameraClick>:
    orientation: 'vertical'
    Camera:
        id: camera
        resolution: (640, 480)
        play: False
    ToggleButton:
        text: 'Play'
        on_press: root.toggle_play()
        size_hint_y: None
        height: '48dp'
    Button:
        text: 'Capture'
        size_hint_y: None
        height: '48dp'
        on_press: root.capture()
""")
